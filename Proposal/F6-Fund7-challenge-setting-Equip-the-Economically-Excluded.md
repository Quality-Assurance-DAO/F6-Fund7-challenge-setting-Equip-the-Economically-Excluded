## Campaign

F6: Fund7 challenge setting

## Challenge Title

Equip the Economically Excluded

## Challenge question :

How can Cardano provide the resources to enable economically excluded people to run their own projects ?

## Why is it important?

To "create possibility for the many, as well as the few", Cardano can equip the economically disadvantaged to build their own solutions.

## How does success look like?

Autonomous solutions built by economically disadvantaged communities.

## Key Metrics to measure

Sustainable community projects.

Autonomous use of Cardano technology to transform the economic and social conditions of economically disadvantaged communities.

Successful transfer of privileged knowledge to excluded communities.

## Challenge brief

### In Draft

Rather than provide a prescriptive picklist of Socially Excluded Communities, I think it is important that proposals submitted under this challenge include an explanation of how their targeted community is economically excluded and marginalized.

In my UK context, economic exclusion and marginalisation typically applies to the long-term unemployed; those who are disabled; homeless people; ex-offenders; refugees and asylum-seekers. But in other countries this context may change.
